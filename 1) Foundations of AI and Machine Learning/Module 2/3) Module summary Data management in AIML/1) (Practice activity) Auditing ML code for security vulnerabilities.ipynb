    "\n",
    "As you review the code, look for potential security vulnerabilities such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data validation and sanitization: Is the input data validated or sanitized to prevent malicious input?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input validation: Are there any checks on the input data to ensure it meets expected formats or values?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random state and seed management: Is the random state used securely to prevent predictability in model training?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model security: Are there security measures in place to protect the model from tampering or unauthorized access?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encryption: Is sensitive data, such as the trained model, encrypted when stored or transmitted?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrity checks: Are there mechanisms to verify the integrity of the model when loading it from storage?\n",

    "\n",
    "    - Mitigation: Implement input validation and sanitization routines before processing the data. For example, ensure that the CSV file only contains expected data types and values.\n",

    "Based on your findings, propose improvements to the provided code block to enhance its security. Rewrite sections of the code where necessary, incorporating best practices such as:\n",
